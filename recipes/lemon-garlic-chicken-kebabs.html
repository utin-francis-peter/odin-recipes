      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>½ medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
      <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon thyme leaves</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and
        select Saute function. Heat vegetable oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper on both sides; add to Instant
        Pot®. Cook one side at a time until both sides of the chicken are a
        golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken from the pot and
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion and sauté for 1 minute. Add garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
        Pour in white wine and stir to scrape brown bits from the bottom of the
        pot. Stir in chicken broth and lemon juice; bring to a boil and cook
        until broth has reduced slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the Sauté
        function.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return chicken Instant Pot®. Close and lock the lid. Select High
        pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10
        minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
      </li>
      <li>
        Release pressure using the natural-release method according to
        manufacturer's instructions, for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure
        carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and
        remove the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from the pot and set aside. Select the Sauté mode and
        bring sauce to a boil. Whisk in butter or margarine, heavy cream, salt,
        and thyme. Cook until sauce has thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.
        Serve chicken drizzled with the sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
