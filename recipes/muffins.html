    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These basic muffins can be made as-is, or you can add one of several
      different ingredients for a variety of muffins. All options are delicious!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup
        muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl;
        make a well in the center.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat egg with a fork in a small bowl or 2-cup measuring cup; whisk in
        milk and oil. Pour egg mixture all at once into flour mixture; mix
        quickly and lightly with a fork until just moistened. The batter will be
        lumpy. (Fold in additional ingredients if using; see variations below).
        Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed,
        about 25 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
